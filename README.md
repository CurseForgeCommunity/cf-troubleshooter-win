## Features

### Compatibility mode checker
Have you accidentally set some applications to run in compatibility mode, and now your Minecraft looks like it's from 2009?

### Hosts checker
Have you installed certain launchers that modify how you access certain servers, and now things won't work when you want to?

### Duplicate mod checker (Very much work in progress)
Installed mods both by using the app and dragging/dropping into the mods folder?
